Running the program:
Program may be opened using F5 or F6 buttons within Atom.
Please ensure the button used launches Python 3.

#####ABOUT THE PROGRAM######

Program is an attempt at a scientific calculator.

The program was designed on MAC OS. This has an effect on the resolution at which the
buttons and other components are displayed. This affects line 9 self.main.geometry field
where the x,y sizing needs to be made larger if using on a windows pc.
The default size has been set to suit most windows resolutions, please read the comments if
you would like to select size for MAC OS.

Functions that fall outside of pythons standard eval function have been
defined under the calculator class structure.

It should be noted that had other modules been allowed, Math module would have
enabled the easy implementation of other functions such as Trig(sin, cos, tan), etc.

The program attempts to demonstrate learning achieved this semester with recursive-
algorithms, sub-functions, and OOP principles utilised.
